# Simple PRD Template (For Beginners)

**Never written a PRD before? This version is for you.**

Just fill in the blanks. Skip anything you don't know—Claude will help you figure it out later!

## 1. What Are You Building? (2-3 sentences)

Describe your app like you're explaining it to a friend.

**Example:**
```
I want to build a focus timer app for people who struggle to concentrate. It will have
a 25-minute timer, a task list, and calming music. Like Pomodoro apps but with better
music and a cleaner design.
```

**Your turn:**
```
[Write your description here]
```

---

## 2. Who Is This For?

Who will use your app?

**Example:**
```
- Students studying for exams
- Freelancers working from home
- Anyone who gets distracted easily
```

**Your turn:**
```
[Who will use this?]
```

---

## 3. What Can Users DO? (5 Main Features)

List 5 things users can do in your app. Don't worry about HOW yet, just WHAT.

**Example:**
```
1. Start a 25-minute focus timer
2. Add tasks to a todo list
3. Play focus music while working
4. See how many sessions completed today
5. Track total focus time this week
```

**Your turn:**
```
1. [First thing users can do]
2. [Second thing]
3. [Third thing]
4. [Fourth thing]
5. [Fifth thing]
```

## 4. Where Will People Use It?

Check all that apply:

- [ ] Computer web browser (desktop)
- [ ] Phone web browser (mobile)
- [ ] iPhone app
- [ ] Android app
- [ ] Other: ___________

**Not sure?** Choose "Computer web browser"—it's the easiest to start with!

---

## 5. How Should It Look?

Describe the vibe you want, or name apps you want to copy the style from.

**Example:**
```
Clean and minimal like Linear. Dark mode like Spotify. Smooth animations like Apple.
```

**Your turn:**
```
[Describe the look/feel or name apps you like]
```

---

## 6. What Makes Your App Special?

What's the ONE thing that makes your app different or better?

**Example:**
```
Most focus apps play generic music. Mine uses AI-generated "flow state" music
specifically designed to help you concentrate without distraction.
```

**Your turn:**
```
[Your unique thing]
```

---

## 7. How Fast Do You Want to Build This?

Be honest—no judgment!

**Example:**
```
I want a working version in 2 weeks so I can start using it myself.
```

**Your turn:**
```
[Your timeline]
```

---

## 8. Do You Know What Tech to Use? (Optional)

If you know you want to use specific tools, list them here. If you don't know, skip this—Claude will recommend tools for you!

**Example:**
```
- I've heard React is popular, so maybe that?
- Not sure about the rest
```

**Your turn:**
```
[List tech preferences or write "Not sure"]
```

---

## 9. Will You Charge Money for It?

Think about your long-term plan (but this can change later!)

**Example:**
```
Free for now. Maybe $5/month later if people like it.
```

**Your turn:**
```
[Monetization plan or "Not sure"]
```

---

## 10. Anything Else?

Any other details, inspirations, or constraints?

**Example:**
```
- I want to use this myself every day (building for me first)
- Budget: $50/month max for hosting
- Solo founder, no design skills
```

**Your turn:**
```
[Anything else important?]
```
